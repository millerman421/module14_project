<p>The SVM machine learning model performance was better than the Logistic Regression model because it had the SVM model had slightly higher accuracy score of 0.55 compared to 0.52 for the Logistic Regression model. Additionally the, recall for buy signals (1.0) was 0.96 in the SVM model compared to 0.66 in the Logistic Regression model. This measure indicates the SVM model was 96% accurate predicting buy signals. However, although both models did not do particually well when predicting sell signals (-1.0), the Logistic Regression model did have a higher recall score of 0.33 compared to the SVM model reccall score of 0.04. If the market were in bear territory, the Logistic Regression model would perform better than the SVM model.</p>
